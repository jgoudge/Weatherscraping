# Weather scraping (BOM)
The purpose of the modules used within this project (weather-au) is to fetch weather data from various Australian Bureau of Meteorology websites to obtain relevant and up-to-date weather reports to be used to hypothesize formation of Ice on Australian Roads.

# Project Description
Retrieve localized weather warnings using temperature and precipitation data from BOM databases to predict the formation of Ice on Australian Roads. When an Area or Road is determined to be susceptible to the formation of Ice, only if required, advice to change driver behavior will be communicated through an HMI (Human interface) situated within the car.
Correct hypothesis of Ice Roads is governed by the following conditions: (advised by http://www.bom.gov.au/metadata/catalogue/19115/ANZCW0503900443?template=full )

•	Road weather alerts are issued when weather elements or phenomena are expected to contribute to hazardous driving conditions

•	Alerts are issued only when conditions are likely to be worse than normal for the season and location.

•	Criteria for issuing Road Weather Alerts are if the following conditions exist and NO severe weather warning is in force:
g) Ice On Roads:

•Defined by the presence of: (accumulated precipitation of greater than 2mm or PoP of greater than 25%) and temperature of less than +2 degrees) within 12 hours of the warning start time or during the warning validity period.
